#Line follower robot simulation using Proteus Turtlebot

There are two separate files for black line and white line follower. 
You can directly load the .hex file in the Proteus 8 Demonstration Turtle bot-Virtual Turtle Follow and Avoid Sample
 project.

Also this project was made using Atmel Studio 7 and contains a .atlsn file which you can build using the editor on 
Atmel Studio. Once the file is built a .hex and .elf file is created in the Debug folder. You can load
those files in Proteus 8 Demonstration Turtle bot by clicking on the microcontroller and deleting the default hex file and loading
this file instead.
