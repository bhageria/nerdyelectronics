Do make sure to update the following lines:

1. `const char* ssid = "XXXXXXXXX";` - Add your Wifi Name here
2. `const char* password = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXx";`  Add your Wifi password here
3. `const char* AWS_endpoint = "XXXXXXXXXXX-ats.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com";` Add your AWS Endpoint here.

The following information will be helpful:

1. **Line number 193** - `snprintf (msg, 75, "{\"Message\": \"Hello from NerdyElectronics.com\" - %d}", count);` This is the line where we create the message which we want to send.

2. **Line number 198** - `client.publish("outTopic", msg);` In this line we publish the message we created in line 175. We publish it to the topic **"outTopic"**. If you want to publish the message to some other topic, edit the topic name here.
